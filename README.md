# Challenges Working With Music and Music Related Data Within My Chosen Project

## Musical Scores 
Diffuculties that arose within the musical scores came within the qualities or these scores. IMSLP offer many different verions of scores, these come in the form of scanned by users of IMSLP. Hence only scans of original manuscripts are available, and only available in PDF form.

## Audio Recording 
Similar issues to the musical scores arose within the audio recordings. This included again a range of quality in the recordings 


## Descrptive Data 
 Issues that arose from this data is that the imformation accuracy reakly depended on on the arrangement and version,. for example the full orchestral one or it has also been arranged for piano, which would change some of the provided descriptive data

# <summary>Week 2</summary>

See below my edited version of a vioin and piano transcription of the opening section of my chosen piec When uploaded on Musescore there were a number of issues faced. The opening scene was not massively effected, However when the piece moved into more intricate notes and articultionsthis is were many erros ocurred. This ranged from pitch and rhythm of the notes. 
Within the base line of the piece there was a change of clef which also was not transcribed by the OMR engine. 
Any grace notes or ornamants of such were also misssing from the transcription

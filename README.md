# Music Analytics and Curation Portfolio


#  Week 1    


>Task 1: Identify a theme for your dataset


The theme i have chosen for my data set will focus around the composer of Tchaichovsky within the Romantic Period. With a particular focus on the first movement of Tchaickovsky's violin concerto in D major.

### Musical Scores
  
  The sheet music for this piece can be found on many sheet music platforms. For the full orchestral score this can be found on IMSLP. Here there are mnay different versions of the score uploaded by different users. These scores range in levels of quality. The violin and piano score can be found on a range of different websites including Musescore and Free violin sheet music. Hence this Piece's sheet music is extremely accessible and free. The physical copy of the sheet music can also be purchased on many popular music sheet music sites such as music room.
  
### Audio Recording 
 
 As it is such a well known piece the audio recording is available on most streaming platforms including spotify and Youtube. There are many different versions of an audio recording. THe audio file can be downloaded also from IMSLP. On IMSLP multiple different MP3 files can be downloaded. these recordings range from recordings on the full piece and also the option to download the individual movement. 

### Metadata and Descriptive data
 For descriptive and metadata, IMSLP does include different forms of metadata in the general information Section. Deoendant on the Arrangement, Composer, Arrranger, publisher info, opus number, number of movements, date of composition, average duration,and composer time period and style> 

 >Task 3 Challenges Working With Music and Music Related Data Within My Chosen Project

### Musical Scores 
Diffuculties that arose within the musical scores came within the qualities or these scores. IMSLP offer many different verions of scores, these come in the form of scanned by users of IMSLP. Hence only scans of original manuscripts are available, and only available in PDF form.

### Audio Recording 
Similar issues to the musical scores arose within the audio recordings. This included again a range of quality in the recordings 


### Descrptive Data 
 Issues that arose from this data is that the imformation accuracy reakly depended on on the arrangement and version,. for example the full orchestral one or it has also been arranged for piano, which would change some of the provided descriptive data

# Week 2

See below my edited version of a violin and piano transcription of the opening section of my chosen piece. When uploaded on Musescore there were a number of issues faced.The opening scene was not massively effected, However when the piece moved into more intricate notes and articultionsthis is were many erros ocurred. This ranged from pitch and rhythm of the notes. Within the base line of the piece there was a change of clef which also was not transcribed by the OMR engine. Any grace notes or ornamants of such were also misssing from the transcription

# Week 3

>Task 1  Export the score you created last week to MusicXML and MEI

See my linked [MEI](https://github.com/rkirk903/MCA-2024/blob/master/data/week3musicxml.mei) and [MusicXML](https://github.com/rkirk903/MCA-2024/blob/master/data/week3musicxml.xml)

>Task 2:render your MEI file using Verovio in GitHub.

# Week 4
> Task 1: Generate a jSymbolic analysis of your piece (Remember, jSymbolic is located in the directory:  C:\Program Files\Jsymbolic)When Generating a JSymbolic anylsis of my piece, i gained the following information

- Range : 60

* Mean Pitch: 62.04

+ Most Common Pitch Class : 45

- Last Pitch : 67

* Most Common rhythmic value : 0.5

  This can also be viewed in my attatched CSV [Download here](https://github.com/rkirk903/MCA-2024/blob/master/week4values.csv)

> Task 2 generate a piano roll and pitch histogram of your piece using music21.


See below my piano roll generated using music 21 :
